- In the photos carousel the back button doesn't show (I can still click it though)
Easy fix

- after uploading a photo I am rerouted to the photo stream but I don't see my uploaded photo unless I refresh the page.
Hard fix, but know generally what to do

- after uploading a photo while looking at someone else's stream I seem to be seeing photos of other users as well. Again, after refreshing the page things go back to normal.
Will have to test
- when looking at a user's stream and then looking at another's stream I still see photos of the previous user.
Will have to test
